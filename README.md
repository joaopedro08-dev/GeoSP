## üì± About the project
GeoSP is a simple and intuitive tourism app, created to explore the best of the city of S√£o Paulo, the vibrant capital of the state. This was my first project using the "tabs" template, one of the most popular for Android and iOS apps, right after mastering the "blank" template in Ionic. In addition, GeoSP marked my first dive into using artificial intelligence, integrating Gemini in a simple but exciting way. Another highlight was the implementation of Vlibras, an essential accessibility tool for people with disabilities, developed by the Brazilian federal government.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
The app is organized into five practical tabs:

1. **Restaurants**: Discover the best gastronomic spots in S√£o Paulo, with Google Maps integration to facilitate your visit.
2. **Trips**: Explore the main tourist destinations in the city, also with access to Google Maps.
3. **Adventures**: Find the best places for adventures and outdoor activities, with direct navigation via Google Maps.
4. **Home**: Learn more about the app and its features in a clear and informative description.
5. **Chatbot**: Interact with a simple chatbot powered by Gemini AI to ask questions and get tips.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies used
- **Languages**: HTML, CSS (Sass), TypeScript
- **Frameworks**: Ionic, Angular
- **Other tools**: Gemini API, Google Maps, Google Fonts

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
The GeoSP project, developed with Ionic and Angular, generates several files. To keep everything organized, the structure was divided as follows:

### üìÅ Folders
- `/android`: Folder generated by Capacitor, containing files specific to the Android project.
- `/ios`: Folder generated by Capacitor, containing files specific to the iOS project.
- `/resources`: Stores app icons and optionally the splash screen.
- `/src`: The heart of the project, where the root file `index.html`, the style file `global.scss`, and the subfolders `app`, `assets`, and `environments` (where the API is configured) are located.
- `/www`: Folder that automatically receives compiled data when syncing or copying from the browser to the Android project. No manual changes are required.

### üìÑ Files
- `capacitor.config.ts`: File where the app name and other configurations are defined to generate the Android and iOS projects.
- `angular.json`: Currently requires no changes but can be used for future improvements in the project.
- `tsconfig.json`: Similar to `angular.json`, it doesn't need changes except in specific or urgent cases.

## üìã Requirements
To install and run GeoSP on your device or set up the development environment, you need the following requirements:

- [**Android Studio**](https://developer.android.com/studio): IDE used to generate the `.apk` file for Android devices.
- [**Xcode**](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/): IDE required to generate the `.ipa` file for iOS devices.
- [**CocoaPods**](https://cocoapods.org/): Essential tool for managing dependencies in iOS development. Install with:  
  ```bash
  sudo gem install cocoapods
  ```
- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Recommended code editor for working with HTML, CSS (Sass), and TypeScript.
- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/): Required to use `npm`, the package manager. LTS version is recommended.
- [**Ionic CLI**](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli): Needed to develop and compile the Ionic project. Install it globally with the command:

## üë®‚Äçüíª Project Development
If you want to work on GeoSP development, follow the instructions below to set up and run the environment locally.

1. Download the project from GitHub
2. Open in Visual Studio Code with the project folder already installed
3. **Start the local server:** In Visual Studio Code, open the terminal (shortcut Ctrl + Shift + P, type "Terminal" and select "New Terminal" or click "Terminal" in the top menu) and run the command below to view the project in the browser:
   ```bash
   ionic serve
   ```
4. **Troubleshooting (optional):** If the project doesn't work, install the necessary dependencies with the following commands:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install @google/generative-ai
   npm install @capacitor/assets --save-dev
   ```

### ü§ñ Android
If you want to work on web development and generate the app only for **Android**, follow the steps below:

1. **Sync the data:** To copy the web project files to the `android` folder use:
   ```bash
   ionic capacitor copy android
   ```
2. **Compile the project:** To generate a new Android build (or recreate the `android` folder from scratch), run:
   ```bash
   ionic capacitor build android
   ```
3. **Generate icons and splash screens (Optional):** Place the icon files (recommended: 1024x1024px) and splash screen (recommended: 2732x2732px) in the `resources` folder. Then run the following command after the previous `build`:
   ```bash
   npx capacitor-assets generate
   ```
4. **Open in Android Studio:** After the **build**, **Android Studio** will open automatically, and a prompt to start the app created by **Capacitor** may appear in the bottom right corner.
5. **Generate the APK:** In **Android Studio**, click on the top menu **Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)**. After the build, click **Locate** to find the `app-debug.apk` file in the output folder.
6. **Install on the device:** Connect an **Android** device to the computer via USB, transfer the `app-debug.apk` file to the device and install it. Make sure the "Install from unknown sources" option is enabled in the device settings.
> üí° **Tip:** For the best experience, ensure that all tools (Android Studio, Node.js, Ionic CLI, and VSC) are installed and configured correctly before starting.

### üçè iOS
If you want to work on web development and generate the app only for **iOS**, follow the steps below:

1. **Sync the data:** To copy the web project files to the `ios` folder use:
   ```bash
   ionic capacitor copy ios
   ```
2. **Compile the project:** To generate a new iOS build (or recreate the `ios` folder from scratch), run:
   ```bash
   ionic capacitor build ios
   ```
3. **Generate icons and splash screens (Optional):** Place the icon files (recommended: 1024x1024px) and splash screen (recommended: 2732x2732px) in the `resources` folder. Then run the following command after the previous `build`:
   ```bash
   npx capacitor-assets generate
   ```
4. **Open in Xcode:** After the **build**, **Xcode** will open automatically. Make sure you are signed into an **Apple Developer Program** account in **Xcode** settings to generate the `.ipa` file.
5. **Generate the .ipa file:** In **Xcode**, click **Product > Archive** in the top menu. This will create a **build** file for the app. Follow the on-screen instructions to sign the app with a valid certificate.
6. **Export the file:** After archiving, the "**Organizer**" window will open automatically. Select the generated file, click **Distribute App**, choose the desired option (like "**Ad Hoc**" for device testing), and export the `.ipa` file.
7. **Install on the device:** Connect an **iOS** device to the Mac via USB. Use **Xcode** or tools like **Apple Configurator** to transfer and install the `.ipa` file on the device.
   > **Note:** The "Install from unknown sources" option is not required on iOS, but the device must be registered to the Apple Developer account associated with the certificate used in the **build**.
> üí° **Tip**: Ensure all tools (Xcode, CocoaPods, Node.js, Ionic CLI, VSC) are correctly set up. Install CocoaPods with:  
```bash
